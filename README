Steps:

- Simulation: Create games by simulating computer vs computer matches.  Pick the AI for each player.  Initially, this must be random vs random

- Visualize: View an existing saved game

- Process: Convert a set of saved games into training data suitable for the neural network

- Train: Using the juypyter notebook, train a model on the data

- Play: Play against a trained model


The executable to do all of the above is:

python four.py
